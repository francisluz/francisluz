I'm a Full-Stack software engineer who most of the time is developing backend stuff, using Python, NodeJs and some others, big fun of Javascript and its frameworks like React, Angular and friends. 

☁️ Cloud computing is something that I am really into from Azure, Google Cloud, AWS to Heroku and Vercel.
